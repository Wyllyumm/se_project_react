# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

-This project utilizes React to dynamically display the current time, weather conditions, and even suggestions of what to wear when going outside.
-Through the use of https://home.openweathermap.org's api key, it helps display the current weather conditions flipping through conditions such as rain, snow, clouds, and clear skies. The current weather condition is constantly being updated based on the time and location utilizes through React and jsx code.
-The use of dynamic code filters through clothing suggestions and displays clothing suggestions based current conditions.
-Once additional functionality is added, users will be able to add even more clothing suggestions with the options of filtering said suggestions with weather conditions between hot, cold, and warm.
